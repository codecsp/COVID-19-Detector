This project is a web application which helps people to find their chances(probability) of having
covid-19. For this project purpose, I have created a dummy dataset to train my model.
<br>
<br>
If the model is trained using proper dataset then it can surely predict much better.
<br>
<br>

<h1> Motivation behind this Idea : </h1>	

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the current scenario spread due to covid-19 in our country of India where the ratio of medical facilities
per human is very less, pandemic disease can prove a major threat than any other thing.</li>
  <li>Also testing equipments are also very less so there is always a problem to decide the priority for testing for a disease.</li>
  <li>So what if theres a machine learning model which can help the people to check the chances of having covid-19 by entering 
thier symptoms.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to run the application : </h1>

<h3> Step 1: </h3> clone this repository by entering the command : git clone https://github.com/codecsp/COVID-19-Detector.git DIR<br>
(Go to the DIR and ypu will the project files listed there)

<h3> Step 2: </h3> To execute this application, system must have flask installed.

to install flask, enter the command on your terminal : <b>  <i> pip install flask </b> </i>

<h3> Step 3: </h3>Execute the <b><i>main.py</i></b> file by just using the command python3 main.py
(Flask server will be generated and you will get an endpoint, copy that)

<h3> Step 4: </h3>Enter  the <b><i> url (endpoint) </b> </i> in your browser and you are ready to go.
