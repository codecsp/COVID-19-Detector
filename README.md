This project is a web application which helps people to find their chances(probability) of having
covid-19. For this project purpose, I have created a dummy dataset to train my model.

If the model is trained using proper dataset then it can surely predict much better.

Motivation behind this Idea :

Understanding the current scenario spread due to covid-19 in our country of India where the ratio of medical facilities
per human is very less, pandemic disease can prove a major threat than any other thing. Also testing equipments are also very 
less so there is always a problem to decide the priority for testing for a disease.

So what if theres a machine learning model which can help the people to check the chances of having covid-19 by entering 
thier symptoms.

How to run the application :
 
step 1: clone this repository by entering the command : git clone https://github.com/codecsp/COVID-19-Detector.git DIR
(Go to the DIR and ypu will the project files listed there)
 
step 2: To execute this application, system must have flask installed.

to install flask, enter the command on your terminal : pip install flask

step 3 : execute the main.py file by just using the command python3 main.py
(Flask server will be generated and you will get an endpoint, copy that)

step 4 : Enter  the url (endpoint) in your browser and you are ready to go.

step 5: enter the details based on the symptoms and you will your probability.
